# Project Status and Interaction History

## Project: Bracket City Aid

This is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the user experience of The Atlantic's Bracket City game. It provides a side panel to help users track their guesses and progress.

### Current Status

*   **Bug Fix:** The core logic for updating the color of parent brackets has been fixed. When a user clears a guessed word, the parent bracket now correctly turns red.
*   **Optimization:** The project has been optimized for submission to the Chrome Web Store. This includes an improved `manifest.json`, better code comments, and a more intuitive UI.
*   **Version Control:** The project is under Git version control and has been pushed to the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/jorgealbarran/bracketcityaid

### Interaction History

*   **Initial Request:** The user requested a fix for a logic bug where parent brackets would remain blue even if a child bracket's guess was cleared.
*   **Analysis:** I analyzed the codebase, focusing on `script.js`, to identify the source of the bug.
*   **Bug Fix:** I corrected the `handleGuess` function in `script.js` to properly nullify the `guessedWord` when the input is cleared.
*   **Optimization:** I improved the `manifest.json` with a more descriptive text, added comments to the code for better readability, and made a minor UI improvement in `style.css`.
*   **Git Integration:** I initialized a Git repository, created a `.gitignore` file, and pushed the project to the user's GitHub repository.
*   **README Creation:** I created a `README.md` file with a description of the project, its features, and instructions on how to use it.
*   **README Update:** The user updated the `README.md` file, and I committed and pushed the changes.
*   **Status File:** I created this `status.md` file to document the project's status and our interaction history. I have also added this file to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to the repository.
